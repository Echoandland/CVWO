In this website,I created 5 pages:
login, register, mainpage, testpage, accountpage
You can download all the files, and "npm start"in your computer,
however,there exist some issues with my frontend and backend (something
about url connction) and as I register it seems cannot store the account
information(the console says registration error ).

So i will appreciate it if you can kindly tell me how to fix it(btw, my testpage and accoutpage have already set well and there may be only one issue with database and the connection before I can finally run the whole website )

Apology much for that! I really look forward to your patience and looking through my work,as well as your kind advice!
